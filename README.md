### Known issues
1. Due to a bug on Windows, if you see error saying fail to bind cam socket or mic socket, run client first, then open hotspot.
2. Obvious lagging if network is not stable.

### Further Plan
Currently, this project is stagnant as both of us are busy applying for graduate schools. We got the hard coded RTSP based version working on both side, but no time to finish it.  
We will not be able to continue developing until Dec
